# CAN Bus Based Automatic Water-Level Gate Control System

## Overview

The CAN Bus Based Automatic Water-Level Gate Control System is a distributed embedded system developed using three LPC2129 ARM7 microcontroller nodes.

The system automatically senses the water level, communicates the measured value through a CAN bus, displays the corresponding level and status, and controls a gate using a servo motor.

## Objective

To design and implement a distributed embedded system using three LPC2129 microcontroller nodes communicating over a CAN bus to automatically sense the water level, display the corresponding status, and control a gate through a servo motor without manual intervention.

## System Architecture

The system consists of three independent LPC2129 nodes connected through a shared CAN bus.

### Node 1 - Sensing Node

- Uses an MCP3204 12-bit SPI ADC.
- A potentiometer is used as the water-level sensor stand-in.
- Reads the analog input through SPI.
- Transmits the raw ADC value through CAN2.

### Node 2 - Display Node

- Receives the ADC value through CAN.
- Classifies the value into Level 1, Level 2, or Level 3.
- Displays the water-level and gate status on a 16x2 LCD.
- Indicates the current level using three LEDs.

### Node 3 - Actuation Node

- Receives the same CAN data independently.
- Determines the corresponding water-level.
- Controls a servo motor according to the detected level.

## Working Principle

1. The potentiometer provides a variable analog signal representing the water level.
2. MCP3204 converts the analog signal into a 12-bit digital value.
3. Node 1 reads the ADC value through SPI.
4. Node 1 transmits the value through CAN2.
5. Node 2 and Node 3 receive the CAN data independently.
6. Node 2 displays the level and gate status on the LCD and indicates the level using LEDs.
7. Node 3 controls the servo motor according to the detected level.

The ADC produces values from 0 to 4095.

## Level Control

| Level | Status | Servo Position |
|---|---|---|
| Level 1 | Low level / Gate Closed | 0° |
| Level 2 | Medium level | 90° |
| Level 3 | High level / Gate Fully Open | 180° |

## Communication

### SPI

SPI is used for communication between Node 1 and the MCP3204 ADC.

### CAN

CAN is used for communication between the three LPC2129 nodes. Node 1 broadcasts the ADC reading, while Node 2 and Node 3 independently receive and process the same data.

## ADC Conversion

MCP3204 is a 12-bit ADC with an output range of 0 to 4095.
